## Cloud Portability & Tooling
I have delivered production data platforms across **Azure and AWS**, and work with architectures that map directly to **GCP-based stacks**. My experience with Databricks, Spark, SQL warehouses, Airflow-style orchestration, and dbt-style analytics engineering enables rapid transition to platforms such as BigQuery, Cloud Composer, and Vertex AI.
